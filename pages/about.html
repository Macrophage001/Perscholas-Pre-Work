			<p id="intro">&emsp;Hi and welcome to my page. My name is Darnell Champen and I am an aspiring software/game developer. 
			I have been programming and developing small projects since 2008 and released a couple of the projects in recent years to the Android Play Store. 
			Making/Playing games has always been a passion of mine. Ever since I was younger I'd spend my time on my dad's computer writing up simple DOS Scripts for Text-Based adventure games or playing some amazing games like Megaman and Unreal Tournament with him.
			I've never forgotten those days and I really hope to one bring that same level of happiness and nostalgia to others. 
			If you've stopped by to take a look, I'd really appreciate it if you gave some of projects a quick look and provide any criticisms you may have as I constantly seek to improve. 
			All of my games will be free for the forseeable future until I feel confident enough to make a game worth selling. Thanks again for stopping by!</p>

			<h3 id="projectUniversePrototype">Universe Prototype [WIP]</h3>
			<p>Currently not much to it. I'm still working my way through making interesting and dynamic planets, and atmospheric systems via <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=rayleigh+scattering">Rayleigh Scattering</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="projectCircuitBricker">Circuit Bricker</h3>
			<p>This was the first game that I felt comfortable actually releasing to the public. It didn't really have much particularly special going for it other than some cool power-ups and lots of particle effects (because who doesn't like particle effects =D) but I am very proud of this fun but a little buggy mess. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MacrophageDev.CircuitBricker&hl=en_US&gl=US">Link</a>
			in case anyone wants to try the game out. It's genuinely good fun for a bit if you like brick breaker style games.</p>

			<h3 id="projectGuildInc">Guild Inc.</h3>
			<p>I really enjoy incremental games so I decided to take a stab at making one. It was heavily inspired by another game actually called Egg Inc. (Where I got my uncreative name =D). There a lot of aspects of that game that I really enjoyed and wanted to incorporate them into a different theme with a few new twists here and there.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the pictures on the Play Store are a bit outdated, the game looks significantly better now, like night and day with transparent water, my own custom models instead of free assets, and more visual and audio effects to give them a nicer feel. I will be updating the images soon.</p>
			<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MacrophageDev.GuildInc&hl=en_US&gl=US">Link</a> in case any of you would like to try it out. Feel free to provide any feedback, I'd more than appreciate it =D.</p>

				My name is Euris Gonzalez, a Latino raised in the Bronx living with his mother and two younger sisters.
				Fun fact about me is that in high school I was part of my school marching band where I was a drummer.
				During my school years I taught myself how to play instruments like piano and guitar. While getting my associates degree I was introduced to 
				programming. I was enrolled in an intro class for web development and was taught simple HMTL and CSS. The class was only an elective
				but I realized early how valuable it was. Fast foward now, I wanted to dive into the tech industry but didn't know where to start.
				After researching for coding programs I came across Per Scholas and felt it was exactly what I was looking for.

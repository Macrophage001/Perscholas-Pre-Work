			<p id="intro">&emsp;Hi and welcome to my page. My name is Darnell Champen and I am an aspiring software/game developer. 
			I have been programming and developing small projects since 2008 and released a couple of the projects in recent years to the Android Play Store. 
			Making/Playing games has always been a passion of mine. Ever since I was younger I'd spend my time on my dad's computer writing up simple DOS Scripts for Text-Based adventure games or playing some amazing games like Megaman and Unreal Tournament with him.
			I've never forgotten those days and I really hope to one bring that same level of happiness and nostalgia to others. 
			If you've stopped by to take a look, I'd really appreciate it if you gave some of projects a quick look and provide any criticisms you may have as I constantly seek to improve. 
			All of my games will be free for the forseeable future until I feel confident enough to make a game worth selling. Thanks again for stopping by!</p>

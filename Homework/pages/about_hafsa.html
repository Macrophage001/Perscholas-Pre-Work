				<p>Hi guys!! My name is Hafsa and I am from Pakistan but born and raised in NYC. I am a recent graduate of NYU with a B.A in economics.</p>
				<p>After graduation I did a co-op at Mount Sinai as a data analyst. Although I learned alot I realized data analysis was not for me.</p>
				<p>During undergrad one of my proudest accomplishments was co-founding the NYU Stern Islamic Finance Group (IFG)</p>
				<p>You can learn more about IFG by clicking the link: <a href="https://sternifg.com/whyifg"> What's IFG?</a></p>
